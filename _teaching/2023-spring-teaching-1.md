MT2002: Statistical Modeling 

CS2008: Numerical Computing

===============Details are below============================


In MT2002: Statistical Modeling, I instructed students in the art of inference through models, leveraging PyMC for advanced probabilistic reasoning and decision-making. In CS2008: Numerical Computing, I guided students in employing various approximation techniques to solve diverse computational problems efficiently, fostering a deep understanding of numerical analysis principles.
